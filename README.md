👋 
Hi, I’m @MereMer. Or you can call me Fenix :)

👀 
I'm a person who likes the new more than the old. I love change, but I'm also very sensitive to details and regularities. I like capturing new things, innovation and value are my biggest drivers. I am able to think independently, in the meantime, I can communicate with a wide variety of people.

👩🏻‍💼 
I learned the importance of customer service during my first internship in a securities company. Then I went to another securities for deeper diving into finance. These valuable experiences made me realize the crucial role data plays in every industry. Later, I worked in the overseas operations department of a non-profit organization founded entirely by young people. And during that time I realized that I really enjoyed the process of brainstorming and implementing strategies with my partners. Next, I would like to continue my career exploration in IT and business consulting.

🎓 
My major is Applied Business Analytics, which is an interdisciplinary program. I have dabbled in a wide range of applications of Business Analytics for various purposes, but I still need to supplement more advanced knowledge. I am learning computer programming for Data Science (mainly Python and SQL), Mathematical Statistics, and Cloud Architecture Solutions, and I even attend a Machine Learning Specialization Program launched by Dr. Andrew Ng to improve my data worldview. Additionally, I enriched my Tableau-supported practice of data visualization to accomplish my analytics loop logically. 
Currently, I'm looking for my first job as a New Graduate, hope I can make it!
