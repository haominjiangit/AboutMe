👋 
Hi, I’m @Haomin Jiang :)

👀 
I'm a person who likes the new more than the old. I love change, but I'm also very sensitive to details and regularities. I like capturing new things, innovation and value are my biggest drivers. I am able to think independently, in the meantime, I can communicate with a wide variety of people.

🎓 
My major is Applied Business Analytics, which is an interdisciplinary program. I have dabbled in a wide range of applications of Data Analytics for various purposes. Now I am diving deeper into Python and Programming, SQL and Database, Data Structure and Algorithm, Data Science, Mathematical Statistics, and Cloud Architecture. Additionally, I enriched my skill set by gaining multiple certifications, like Tableau Desktop Specialist and Machine Learning Specialization(in progress). 

👩🏻‍💼 
I learned the importance of how to deliver high-quality work through teamwork during my valuable internship experiences. And they also made me realize the crucial role data plays in every industry. Later, I worked on various projects with totally different targets. And during that time I found that I really enjoyed the process of brainstorming and reaching milestones with my partners. Next, I would like to continue my career exploration in IT and Business. Currently, I'm looking for my first full-time job as a New Graduate, hope I can make it!
